Data Science from Scratch — for Statisticians

This repository bridges the gap between statistics and data science.
If you already understand statistical inference, probability, and hypothesis testing, this project will help you apply that knowledge to real-world data using Python and modern data science tools.

📚 What You’ll Learn

Python for data analysis (NumPy, pandas)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Data cleaning and feature engineering

Intro to machine learning (Scikit-Learn)

Model evaluation and interpretation

Reproducible workflows (Jupyter, Git)

Practical projects and case studies

👩‍💻 Who It’s For

Students, researchers, or professionals with a background in statistics who want to:

Transition into data science

Strengthen their practical coding and ML skills

Learn hands-on projects with clear explanations

🧠 Prerequisites

Familiarity with basic statistics and probability

Some exposure to programming logic (Python not required but helpful)
